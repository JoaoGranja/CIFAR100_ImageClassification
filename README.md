# CIFAR100_ImageClassification

In this project, a step by step process will be presented for the Image Classification task on CIFAR100 dataset. In this Image Classification problem, not only 
will I design and develop a simple and efficient model from scratch to classify the data but also learn how to implement a pre-trained model.
I will also compare the performance of the two models.

CIFAR100 dataset will be used which is comprised of 60000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. After working on Image Classification for CIFAR10 dataset, I start working with the CIFAR100 dataset which is a bit harder due to larger number of classes.

Image classification is the process of a model classifying input images into their respective category classes. In this project, the two following methods will be used:

<ul>
  <li>Training a small network from scratch </li>
  <li>Fine tuning the top layers of baseline models </li>
</ul>
